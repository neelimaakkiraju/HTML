			books) the integral part of the decimal represents the number of the
			chapter and the fractional parts are arranged in each chapter in order of
			magnitude.<br>Thus in Whittaker and Watson's 1921 A Course of Modern Analysis, chapter 9
			is devoted to Fourier Series;<br>
			within that chapter §9.6 introduces Riemann's theory, the following
			section §9.61 treats an associated function, following §9.62 some
			properties of that function, following §9.621 a related lemma, while §9.63
			introduces Riemann's main theorem, and so on.<br />
			<b>Whittaker and Watson attribute this system of numbering to Giuseppe Peano
			on their "Contents" page, although this attribution does not seem to be
			widely credited elsewhere.<br />[7] Gradshteyn and Ryzhik is another book
			using this scheme since its third edition in 1951.</b>
